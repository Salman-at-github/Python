# Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

# If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

 

# Example 1:

# Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
# Output: "fl"
# Example 2:

# Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
# Output: ""
# Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
 

# Constraints:

# 1 <= strs.length <= 200
# 0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
# strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters.

# To solve the given problem, we can iterate through the characters of the first string in the array and compare them with the corresponding characters in the remaining strings. We keep track of the common prefix characters and return the result at the end.

# Here's the code with a line-by-line explanation:

# ```python
def longestCommonPrefix(strs):
    if not strs:  # Check if the input array is empty
        return ""

    prefix = ""  # Initialize an empty string to store the common prefix

    for i in range(len(strs[0])):  # Iterate through the characters of the first string
        char = strs[0][i]  # Get the character at the current position

        for j in range(1, len(strs)):  # Iterate through the remaining strings
            if i >= len(strs[j]) or strs[j][i] != char:
                return prefix  # Return the common prefix if the characters don't match

        prefix += char  # Append the matching character to the common prefix

    return prefix
# ```

# Explanation:

# 1. We define the function `longestCommonPrefix` that takes the input array of strings `strs` as a parameter.

# 2. We check if the input array is empty by using the `not` operator and the condition `if not strs`. If it is empty, we return an empty string `""` as there is no common prefix to find.

# 3. We initialize an empty string `prefix` that will store the common prefix characters.

# 4. We start iterating through the characters of the first string in the array, `strs[0]`, using the `range(len(strs[0]))` function.

# 5. Inside the loop, we get the character at the current position `i` from the first string and assign it to the variable `char` using `strs[0][i]`.

# 6. We then iterate through the remaining strings in the array using the `range(1, len(strs))` function. The inner loop starts from index 1 because we are comparing the characters of the first string with the other strings.

# 7. Inside the inner loop, we check two conditions: 
#    - If `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the current string `strs[j]`, it means we have reached the end of the current string. In this case, we return the current common prefix stored in the `prefix` variable.
#    - If the character at index `i` in the current string `strs[j]` is not equal to the character `char` from the first string, it means we have found a mismatch. In this case, we also return the current common prefix.

# 8. If the conditions in step 7 are not met, it means the current character `char` matches the character at index `i` in all the other strings. Therefore, we append the matching character to the `prefix` string using the `+=` operator.

# 9. After the loop ends, we have the longest common prefix stored in the `prefix` variable.

# 10. Finally, we return the `prefix`, which represents the longest common prefix among the input strings.

# The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n * m), where n is the length of the longest string in the array and m is the number of strings in the array. We iterate through each character of the first string and compare it with the corresponding characters in the remaining strings, resulting in a nested loop. However, in the worst case, the algorithm may terminate early if a mismatch is found, reducing the actual number of comparisons.

# The auxiliary space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of space to store the common prefix.
